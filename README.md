# algo_compare
An application designed to measure the relative efficiency of different algorithms.

Both algorithms are variations on the Fisher-Yates algorithm, except that one of them uses the inbuilt Math.random javascript function to generate random numbers and the other uses Xorshift.

Users can input how many times they want to run the algo in question, between 1 and 10,000. Upon pressing their respective buttons, the algorithms will run the amount of times requested and then return the starting time, duration and ending time of the test.

You can find it deployed here: https://theamberlamps.github.io/algo_compare/
